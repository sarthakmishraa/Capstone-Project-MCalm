# MCalm
Capstone Project DSN-4099

INTRODUCTION

Our project “MCalm” would detect people’s mood by using their facial expressions as well as by
asking a few questions on a scale of 5, which would help people get a wider picture of their mood.
Next comes the task to enlighten their mood by playing games , listening to jokes by bot and at last
listening to soothing music.

Seeing people busy in the regular hustle and bustle of life and not having enough time to focus on
one’s mental health was one of the major reasons that motivated us to come up with an idea to build
a website that could help people to lighten their mood.
